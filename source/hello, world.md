Welcome to my first blog post, and the reboot of [christianwestbrook.dev](https://www.christianwestbrook.dev/)! I'll kick things off by explaining who I am and why **you should be here**.

# About me

 I'm a Senior Software Engineer in the [space industry](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/space.html) and a PhD candidate at [CSU](https://www.engr.colostate.edu/ece/). In 2016 I founded [an award-winning bookstore and coffee shop](https://www.chaptersonmain.com/).

I'm happily married to [my best friend](https://www.malachiwestbrookphotography.com/). We celebrate our anniversary once every four years (she says I'm her leap day love). We like to play board games and try new coffee shops between DIY projects on our 100 year old home in Arkansas.

 I strive to build things that make the world a better place. I've led and contributed to projects that preserve things I care about:

*   Protecting [public drinking water](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/who-we-are/eesh/remediation.html) from contamination
*   Protecting my coworkers from the spread of COVID-19 in the workplace
*   Protecting the free world from [ballistic missile attacks](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/products/sbirs.html)
*   Protecting the public from [vulnerabilities in deep learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02214) systems

I'm passionate about learning. On paper I've studied information technology, computer science, and computer engineering. In reality I invest a lot of time into learning about things that are meaningful to me. Here are a few recent study topics:

*   Adversarial Machine Learning
*   Spacecraft Dynamics
*   Control Theory
*   Mechatronics
*   Nuclear Chemistry
*   Phased Array Radio Antennas
*   Philosophy
*   PCB Design
*   Wisdom Literature

I've been playing [RuneScape](https://www.runescape.com/community) for nearly twenty years and am working to earn the [max cape](https://runescape.wiki/w/Max_cape). I enjoy playing chess and participating in heavy metal culture. I'm an avid reader and I'm hopelessly addicted to side projects.

# About this blog

This blog is a passion project. I'll use this space to express my thoughts on what I'm learning and working on. I'll share about my projects and talk about the design decisions I'm making along the way. Most of the content here should focus on software, computing, electronics, and radio. You could also reasonably expect to find discussions on physics, math, or philosophy.

The site itself is an [open-source blog engine](https://github.com/christian-westbrook/anansi) that I'm actively iterating on. I plan to include a portfolio engine for organizing a curated list of projects. I'll also develop minimalist social features to enable meaningful conversation and community building. My goal is to help anyone wanting to host their own blog and portfolio have an easy time getting online.
